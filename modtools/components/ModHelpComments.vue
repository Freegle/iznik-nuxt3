      These are the notes for members on your communities, newest first.
    </p>
    <p>
      For GDPR reasons we should not keep notes older than three years unless they are still relevant.  You can
      delete notes from here.

      Soon there will be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A button
        to "bump" the note
      </li>
      <li>
        A mail warning about notes which
        will be automatically deleted if not reviewed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ...but they're not ready yet.
    </p>
