# Freegle Direct Mobile App

This document describes the mobile app version of Freegle, which is built using Capacitor to create native Android and iOS apps from the same Nuxt3 codebase.

---

## ✅ iOS and Android Automated

**Both iOS and Android releases are fully automated via CircleCI.** The CI/CD pipeline builds, version manages, and deploys both platforms in parallel using a shared version number to ensure consistency.

---

## Overview

The mobile app is managed in the `app-ci-fd` branch (based on the original `app` branch) and contains extensive modifications to support native mobile functionality. The app shares most of the Vue components and business logic with the web version but uses a different build configuration and includes native platform code.

<details>
<summary><h2>App Branch vs Master Branch</h2></summary>

The `app-ci-fd` branch (based on the `app` branch) is a **parallel mobile app version** that differs from `master` in several key ways:

### Build Configuration Differences

- **SSR Disabled**: Uses Static Site Generation instead of Server-Side Rendering
- **Build Target**: `static` instead of `server`
- **Environment Flag**: `ISAPP=true` to detect mobile app context
- **No Docker**: Mobile apps don't use the Docker-based infrastructure

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h2>Core Mobile Infrastructure</h2></summary>

### Capacitor Framework

The app uses Capacitor 7 to bridge web code with native functionality:

- **App ID**: `org.ilovefreegle.direct`
- **App Name**: Freegle
- **Config File**: `capacitor.config.ts`
- **Web Directory**: `.output/public` (from Nuxt static build)

### Android Native Files

Located in `android/` directory:

- Complete Android Studio project structure
- Gradle build configuration (`android/app/build.gradle`)
- App icons, splash screens, and resources
- Android manifest with permissions (Camera, Storage, etc.)
- **Version Management**:
  - `versionCode`: Integer build number (e.g., 1202)
  - `versionName`: User-facing version string (e.g., "3.2.0")

### iOS Native Files

Located in `ios/` directory:

- Complete Xcode project structure
- Podfile for CocoaPods dependencies
- iOS-specific icons and assets
- GoogleService-Info.plist for Firebase integration
- **Version Management**:
  - `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`: Build number (e.g., 1200)
  - `MARKETING_VERSION`: User-facing version (e.g., "3.1.9")

<summary><h2>Version Management</h2></summary>

### Unified Version Management (Both Platforms)

**Shared Version Strategy**: Both iOS and Android use the **same version number** to ensure consistency across platforms. A single `increment-version` job runs before both builds, calculates the new version, and shares it via CircleCI workspace.

**Version Name** (e.g., "3.2.38"): Auto-incremented once, shared between platforms
- Stored in CircleCI environment variable `CURRENT_VERSION`
- CircleCI reads current version, increments patch version (3.2.37 → 3.2.38)
- Creates `.new_version` file in workspace with new version
- Both Android and iOS jobs read from this shared file
- **No race conditions** - version calculated once before parallel builds
- Build will FAIL if `CURRENT_VERSION` is not set or has invalid format (must be X.Y.Z)
- **No manual intervention needed** - fully automated

**Version Code/Build Number**: Platform-specific, auto-incremented from stores
- **Android**: Queries Google Play Console (all tracks) for latest version code
- **iOS**: Queries TestFlight for latest build number
- Automatically increments by 1 for each build
- **Minimum version code: 1272** (jumps from lower values if needed, then increments normally)
- Build will FAIL if store APIs are unavailable

### Android Version Management

**Version Code** (e.g., 1272): Auto-incremented from Google Play
- Queries Google Play Console across ALL tracks (internal, beta, production)
- Finds maximum version code across all tracks
- Automatically increments by 1 for each build (1272 → 1273)
- Minimum enforced: if calculated code < 1272, jumps to 1272
- Build will FAIL if Google Play API is unavailable or no releases exist
- **No manual intervention needed** - fully automated

**How Android build works**:
1. CircleCI `increment-version` job reads `CURRENT_VERSION` (e.g., "3.2.37")
2. Auto-increments patch version (3.2.37 → 3.2.38)
3. Saves to `.new_version` in workspace
4. Android job attaches workspace and reads `.new_version`
5. **Updates `config.js` MOBILE_VERSION** with new version (ensures Help page shows correct version)
6. Builds Nuxt app with updated version
7. Queries Google Play for latest version code (e.g., 1271)
8. Auto-increments version code (1271 → 1272, or enforces minimum 1272)
9. Builds AAB and APK with new version (3.2.38 / 1272)
10. Uploads to Google Play Beta Testing (Open Testing)

### iOS Version Management

**Build Number** (e.g., 1272): Auto-incremented from TestFlight
- Queries TestFlight for latest build number for this version
- Automatically increments by 1 for each build (1272 → 1273)
- Minimum enforced: if calculated build < 1272, jumps to 1272
- If no builds exist for this version, starts at 1272
- **No manual intervention needed** - fully automated

**How iOS build works**:
1. CircleCI `increment-version` job creates shared `.new_version` (e.g., "3.2.38")
2. iOS job attaches workspace and reads `.new_version`
3. **Updates `config.js` MOBILE_VERSION** with new version (same as Android)
4. Builds Nuxt app with updated version
5. Queries TestFlight for latest build number for version 3.2.38
6. Auto-increments build number (or enforces minimum 1272)
7. Sets version in Xcode project: `MARKETING_VERSION = 3.2.38`, `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1272`
8. Builds IPA with new version (3.2.38 / 1272)
9. Uploads to TestFlight
10. **Auto-submit to App Store review after 24 hours** (scheduled job)

### Config Version

The `MOBILE_VERSION` in `config.js` is **automatically updated** by BOTH CircleCI jobs before each build:

```javascript
MOBILE_VERSION: '3.2.38'  // Auto-updated by both jobs from shared workspace version
```

This ensures the version shown in the app's Help page matches the actual build version on both platforms. **No manual updates needed** - the version is synchronized automatically during the build process.

### Initial Setup (one-time)

1. Go to CircleCI Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `CURRENT_VERSION` = `3.2.37` (starting version)

**To manually bump major/minor version**:
- Update `CURRENT_VERSION` in CircleCI: `3.2.37` → `4.0.0` or `3.3.0`
- Next build will auto-increment from there: `4.0.0` → `4.0.1`
- Both platforms will use the same version number

   ```

**Notes:**
- **Firebase files** (`google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS) are required for Firebase/Push Notifications. Download from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project Settings → Your app → Download config file
- **App Store Connect API Key**: Create at [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) → Users and Access → Keys → App Store Connect API
- **iOS Certificates**: Export from Xcode or Apple Developer portal as .p12 with a password
- **SENTRY_DSN_APP_FD** is optional but recommended for error tracking. Get from [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) → Project Settings → Client Keys (DSN)

### Verifying GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY

The `GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY` environment variable is **CRITICAL** for:
- Auto-incrementing version codes from Google Play Console
- Uploading builds to Google Play Internal Testing

**Status**: ✅ Properly configured and working (as of build #596)

**Build Behavior**:
- The build will **FAIL** if `GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY` is not set, empty, or invalid
- The build will **FAIL** if it cannot fetch version CODES from Google Play API
- The build will **FAIL** if `CURRENT_VERSION` is not set or has invalid format
- Version NAME is auto-incremented from `CURRENT_VERSION` env var (3.2.29 → 3.2.30)
- Version CODE is auto-incremented from Google Play API (1300 → 1301)
- `CURRENT_VERSION` is updated via CircleCI API after successful build

**Debug Output**: The decode step includes extensive validation:
- ✅ Environment variable is set
- ✅ File created successfully with valid size
- ✅ Valid JSON structure
- 📧 Service account email (for debugging)

**Verification**: Check recent CircleCI builds at https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Freegle/iznik-nuxt3?branch=app-ci-fd
- Look for "✅ Google Play API key file validated" in decode step
- Look for "📱 Current version from CircleCI: X.Y.Z" in deploy step
- Look for "📱 Auto-incremented version name: X.Y.Z → X.Y.(Z+1)" in deploy step
- Look for "📊 Using Play Console internal version code: XXXX" in deploy step
- Look for "📊 New version code: XXXX" in deploy step
- Look for "✅ Successfully uploaded to Google Play Internal Testing!" at end
- Look for "✅ Updated CURRENT_VERSION to X.Y.(Z+1)" in update version step

### Fully Automated Dual-Platform Deployment

Both iOS and Android are built and deployed in parallel with shared version numbers. The workflow ensures consistency across platforms.

**Build Workflow**:

1. **Version Increment Job** (runs first):
   - Reads `CURRENT_VERSION` environment variable (e.g., "3.2.37")
   - Auto-increments patch version (3.2.37 → 3.2.38)
   - Saves to workspace file `.new_version`
   - Both platform jobs read from this shared file

2. **Android and iOS Jobs** (run in parallel):
   - Both attach workspace to read shared version
   - Both update `config.js` MOBILE_VERSION with new version
   - Both build Nuxt app with identical version
   - Both query their respective stores for build numbers
   - Both build and upload to beta/testing tracks
   - **Artifacts stored** for both platforms

**Automated Daily Workflow**:

1. **11:00 PM UTC - Trigger**:
   - Push to `app-ci-fd` branch triggers build
   - OR GitHub Actions can auto-merge `master` → `app-ci-fd` (optional)

2. **Build and Deploy (11:00-11:30 PM UTC)**:
   - **Android**: Uploads to Google Play Beta (Open Testing)
   - **iOS**: Uploads to TestFlight
   - Both use version X.Y.Z (shared) with platform-specific build numbers (minimum 1272)
   - Release notes: "Version X.Y.Z - Bug fixes and improvements"

3. **Auto-Promote/Submit (24 hours later)**:
   - **Android**: Auto-promotes Beta → Production (if not already promoted)
   - **iOS**: Auto-submits latest TestFlight build to App Store review (if not already submitted)
   - Only the LATEST build from last 24 hours is submitted/promoted

### Android-Specific

**Build Process**:
- Queries Google Play for max version code across all tracks
- Auto-increments version code (enforces minimum 1272)
- Builds AAB (for Play Store) and APK (for direct install)
- Uploads to Beta (Open Testing) track
- Auto-promotes to Production after 24 hours

**Google Play Console**:
- Beta Testing: https://play.google.com/console → Your App → Testing → Open testing
- Production: https://play.google.com/console → Your App → Production

**Play App Signing**:
- Enrolled in Google Play App Signing
- Upload key (CircleCI) signs AABs
- App signing key (Google) signs final APKs

**Artifacts**:
- `android-bundle/app-release.aab`
- `android-apk/app-release.apk`

### iOS-Specific

**Build Process**:
- Queries TestFlight for latest build number
- Auto-increments build number (enforces minimum 1272)
- Sets Xcode version: `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`
- Builds IPA with manual code signing
- Uploads to TestFlight
- Auto-submits to App Store review after 24 hours (latest build only)

**App Store Connect**:
- TestFlight: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com → Your App → TestFlight
- App Store: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com → Your App → App Store

**Submission Notes**:
- **One submission per day is safe** - well within Apple's limits
- TestFlight has no daily submission issues
- App Store review typically takes 24 hours (90% of submissions)
- Auto-submit only submits if not already in review/approved

**Artifacts**:
- IPA file stored in CircleCI artifacts

### Manual Triggers

**Build Workflow:**
- Push to `app-ci-fd` branch: triggers full build workflow
- Rerun CircleCI workflow: rebuilds current commit

**Manual Promotion/Submission (via CircleCI):**
To manually trigger promotion/submission before the scheduled time:

1. Go to [CircleCI Pipelines](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Freegle/iznik-nuxt3?branch=app-ci-fd)
2. Click "Trigger Pipeline" (top right)
3. Select branch: `app-ci-fd`
4. Click "Add Parameters" (expand the parameters section)
5. Add parameter:
   - Name: `run_manual_promote`
   - Type: `boolean`
   - Value: `true`
6. Click "Trigger Pipeline"
7. The `manual-promote-submit` workflow will start immediately
8. Both `auto-promote-production` (Android) and `auto-submit-ios` will run in parallel

This allows you to promote/submit releases early without waiting for the midnight scheduled run, and without consuming CircleCI concurrency slots while waiting for approval.

**Alternative - Direct Fastlane:**
- Android: `bundle exec fastlane android auto_promote`
- iOS: `bundle exec fastlane ios auto_submit`
- Manual promotion/submission via store consoles (Google Play Console / App Store Connect)

### Timeline
