                A detailed account of clearing a late father's home using the
                Freegle platform. The author successfully distributed beds,
                furniture, kitchen items, and various household goods to people
                in need, including
                <strong>a newly arrived Nigerian family</strong> and
                <strong>a young photographer</strong>. While most items found
                appreciative recipients, some challenges emerged including
                no-shows and items that wouldn't sell. Overall, the author found
                Freegle effective for clearing the property while helping
                others.
